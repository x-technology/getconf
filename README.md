# get_conf

An educational Flutter project.


## Mobile tool to follow conferences

The idea behind this project is to learn flutter and its pros and cons opposed to React Native. The task is to build an application that allows a user to select number of topics of interest and get alerts when a conference/meetup/event on a specific topic will happen. 
The application interface should be as simple as possible and convenient to use.
Flutter allows to build application for both iOS and Android out of the box. Since recent versions, it also allows to build web apps out of the box.

## Backend:
As a first data source for the tool https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/ should be used.
Other potential sources of events data: 
- email newsletters parsing
- eventbrite
- google forms and telegram bot for manual submission.

### Potential app components in future:
- Online streams
- Past event videos
- Learning material.
