# 22-05-2021 Meetup speech plan

## About me
Software engineer at KPN. Mostly working on react native and python backend.

## About flutter:
Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. 

## About the project
1. Quick project description

## Current status

### Code base description
### Fails
1. Dart
- really close to JS but not quite

2. Calendar component
https://pub.dev/packages/table_calendar
Only can accept List

3. Streaming architecture
- medium and guides, simple use cases, counters 
- js

```
    fetch(/url).then(data => "boom").then(render)
```

- flutter

```
    1. create observable
    2. subscribe
    3. process data
    4. show element
    5. clean up
```

Similar to how angular 2+ does it

4. Datetime issue
- UTC not UTC

5. Current way 
- `if length > 0` 
- `get_occasions_bloc` just exposes the subject
6. The correct way:
- `repositories should be barreled`
- use BLOC library for state management
- Cubit - direct function call to update a state
- BLOC - more sophisticated mechanism that updates state based on an event, map event to 
- Use BlockBuilder
- Separate business logic from representation
